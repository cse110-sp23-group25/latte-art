# Shifting from 3 Variations to 2 Variations
* Decision
  * Our decision is to remove the tarot card variation and reassign group members in that variation team into the other two groups.
* Reasoning
  * This decision comes from the fact that we are approaching our deadline and our progress has not been as quick as we had hoped. In order to hit the deadlines with a presentable product 
  we have decided to lighten the workload.
* What this means going forward
  * This means that we can will delegate smaller tasks to each person which should speed up the process.
