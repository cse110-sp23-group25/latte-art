# Combining the Variations
* Decision
  * Our decision is to combine the two variations as simply as possible
* Reasoning
  * Decision comes from our goals to focus on our variations first and foremost and then shift our focus to finding a better way to combine them once we are confident our variations are in good shape
* What this means going forward
  * This means that we can allocate more time to the development of our variations to ensure we do as good of a job as possible.
