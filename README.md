# fortune-telling-project

* Folder layout:
  * We will be working in these folders in the repository
  * latte-art/html/
  * latte-art/css/
  * latte-art/js/

* Branching:
    * When coding make sure that you make a branch with the following naming convention: 
    “<task>-<name>”
    * Where <task> is the task you are working on and <name> is replaced with your name. (I.e. SeedGeneration-Alex)
    * Convention for names with multiple words will be Pascal Case (EachFirstLetterIsUpperCase)

* Comments:
  * Make sure to comment on the purpose of any confusing sections of code.
  * Also, do not over-comment on self-explanatory things.

* Creating Variables: 
  * camelCase named variables (firstLetterOfFirstWordIsLowerCase)
  * Make the naming of variables understandable rather than commenting on their use beside it. The variable name should be enough to know what it is for. Longer variable names are okay.

* Global Constants:
  * If there are constants named outside of functions, label them all uppercase with underscores.
  * (i.e. CONSTANT_NAME)

 
* Creating Functions:
  * camelCase named functions
  * Comment on the functions purpose (as brief or as in depth as needed)
  * Comment the parameter names, types, and purpose (if applicable)
  * Comment the return type

 
* Creating Files:
  * Naming convention for files will be all lowercase ‘-’ separated.
  * (i.e. latte-art-seed-generation.js)
